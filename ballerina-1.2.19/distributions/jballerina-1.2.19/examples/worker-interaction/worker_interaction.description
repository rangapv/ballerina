// Workers interact with each other by sending and receiving messages.
// Messages are sent and received over a communication channel that is transparent to the user.
// Asynchronous sending of the worker does not wait until the message is delivered whereas synchronous sending waits until the message is delivered.
// Flush can be used to check if all asynchronous messages were sent successfully to a given worker.
// Both synchronous send and flush may fail if a receiving worker returned an error before receiving the messages.
// Similarly ,they may panic if a receiver panicked.

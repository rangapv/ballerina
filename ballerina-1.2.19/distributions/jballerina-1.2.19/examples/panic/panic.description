// In Ballerina, panic indicates abnormal completion and usually implies that something unexpected has occurred
// (i.e., something that should not have occurred during the normal operation). A panic causes
// the call stack to unwind until it is trapped, or if not trapped results in the termination of the program.
//
// Ballerina discourages the use of `panic` to handle program-related
// errors such as "header not found", "data mismatch", etc.). However,
// `panic` can be used in scenarios such as "Connection Closed/Timeout" and "OutOfMemory"
// where the program cannot handle the error by itself.

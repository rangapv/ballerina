// Workers within a fork can access the variables that are declared within the scope of that block.
// The variables can be value-type variables or reference -ype variables.
// Both value-type variables such as `string`, `int`, `float`, and `byte` and reference-type
// variables such as `map`, `json`, `xml`, and `record` are passed into the workers as a reference to the
// original data. Therefore, if you update the value of these variables within a worker, the value gets
// updated for the entire function. You may wait until the worker finishes by using the `wait` expression.

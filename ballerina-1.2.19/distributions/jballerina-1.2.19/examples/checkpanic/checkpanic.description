// `checkpanic` is a unary expression that is used to handle errors.
// The `checkpanic` expression checks the result of the sub expression and panics if the result is `error`.
// Hence, `checkpanic` can be considered as a built-in type-guard for errors where the program will panic
// if the result is an `error`.

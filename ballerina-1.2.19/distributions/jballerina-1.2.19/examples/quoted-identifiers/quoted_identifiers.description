// Ballerina supports quoted identifiers, making it possible to use arbitrary non-empty strings as identifiers,
// including those that are not generally allowed as identifiers (e.g., reserved keywords).
// Quoted identifiers are defined and referenced by prefixing the identifier with the `'` character.

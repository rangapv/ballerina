// The `.clone()` method can be used to make a copy of an `anydata` value.
// `anydata` is equivalent to `()|boolean|int|float|decimal|string|(anydata|error)[]|map<anydata|error>|xml|table`.
// Clone is defined for all structured types that belong to `anydata`.
// The resultant copy is a deep copy.
// A deep copy copies all fields and makes copies of the dynamically-allocated memory that is pointed to by the fields.
// It preserves cycles, storage type, and immutability.
// Cloning an immutable value will return the value itself.

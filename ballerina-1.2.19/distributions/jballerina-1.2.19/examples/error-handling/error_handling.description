// Ballerina distinguishes ordinary errors such as failing to open a file or
// failing to send a network response, from an exceptional condition
// in the code, such as type cast errors.
// Error handling in Ballerina incorporates two different strategies
// depending on the type of error. For ordinary errors such as failing to
// open a file or failing to send a network response,
// the error value is returned.
// When the Ballerina runtime encounters exceptional conditions the runtime
// panics resulting in abrupt completion of execution,
// unless the error is explicitly handled.
//
// Ballerina provides language constructs to handle both returned error values
// and panics. This example demonstrates how errors can be created,
// returned, and how returned errors can be handled.
//
// Ballerina error values are immutable structured values composed of
// an error reason string, a stack trace representing the execution stack
// at the point at which the error value was created,
// and an error detail record.

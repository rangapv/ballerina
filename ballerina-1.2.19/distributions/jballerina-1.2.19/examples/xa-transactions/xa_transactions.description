// Ballerina XA transactions are used when the transaction is happening over
// two or more databases. This example uses two H2 DBs (these
// are created when executing the example). Before running the example, 
// change the DB connection properties as required.
// Ballerina transactions are at the experimental stage.
// Therefore, use  the --experimental flag to enable them.

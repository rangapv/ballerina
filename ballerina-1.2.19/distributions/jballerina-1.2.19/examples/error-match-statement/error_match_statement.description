// The `match` statement in Ballerina only supports value-based match patterns. There are static and structured
// match patterns that can be used with the match clauses. Structured match patterns will take structured
// binding patterns for matching. Error binding pattern is one of the structured binding patterns that can be used
// with the `match` statement.

// Union types are types of which, the set of values is the union of the value spaces of its component types.
// For example, you can use a variable of a union type to store a `string` or an `int`,
// but there is only one type of value at any given time.
// Syntactically, you can define a union type with component types separated by a "|" (i.e., a vertical bar).

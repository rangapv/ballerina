// Ballerina allows defining custom error types to match
// the errors being modeled. User defined error types in Ballerina should have
// a reason type which is a subtype of `string`, and a detail type which
// is a subtype of
// `record {| string message?; error cause?; (anydata|error)...; |}`.
//
// The nature of the default error detail record is that each field is optional
// and can contain additional `anydata|error` fields as required.

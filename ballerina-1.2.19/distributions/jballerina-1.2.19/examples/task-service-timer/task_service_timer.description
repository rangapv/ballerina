// Task Timer Services are used to execute tasks periodically. A timer should
// have an `intervalInMillis` specified and an `initialDelayInMillis` if
// needed. The delay specifies the initial delay before the task is executed
// for the first time. Thereafter, the timer triggers at the provided interval.
// The `onTrigger()` resource is called when the timer triggers. An optional
// `noOfRecurrences` field can be used to provide the maximum number of times
// the Timer should run before shutting down.

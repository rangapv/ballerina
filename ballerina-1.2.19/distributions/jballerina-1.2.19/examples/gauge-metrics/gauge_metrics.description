// Ballerina supports Observability out of the box, and Metrics is one of the three important aspect of the
// Observability. To observe Ballerina code, the '--b7a.observability.enabled=true' property should be given when starting the service.
// The developers can define and use metrics to measure their own logic. A gauge is one type of metric that is
// supported by default in Ballerina, and it represents a single numerical value that can arbitrarily go up and down,
// and also based on the statistics configurations provided to the Gauge, it can also report the statistics such as max,
// min, mean, percentiles, etc.

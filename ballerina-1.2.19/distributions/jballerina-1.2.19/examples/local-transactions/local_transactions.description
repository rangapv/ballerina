// A Ballerina transaction is a series of data manipulation statements 
// that must either fully complete or fully fail, thereby, leaving the
// system in a consistent state. This sample uses an H2 database, which is 
// created when running the sample. Prior to running this sample, 
// the DB connection properties need to be changed as required.
// Ballerina transactions are at the experimental stage,
// Thus, use the --experimental flag to enable them.

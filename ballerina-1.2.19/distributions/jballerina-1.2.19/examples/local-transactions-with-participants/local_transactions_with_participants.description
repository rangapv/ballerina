// A Ballerina transaction is a series of data manipulation statements 
// that must either fully complete or fully fail, thereby, leaving the
// system in a consistent state. This example demonstrates the usage of
// transactions with local participants. If the participant panics even when it
// is trapped and if the initiator completes, the transaction is considered as a failure.
// Ballerina transactions are at the experimental stage.
// Hence, use the --experimental flag to enable them.

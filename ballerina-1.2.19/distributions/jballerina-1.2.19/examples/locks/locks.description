// Ballerina locks are used for concurrency management. The encapsulating block of statements will acquire
// the locks for each global or service level variable reference that is used within the block or for any
// field access of an object or a record. When there is nested field access (e.g., a record within a record),
// all the field accesses of the records will be locked.
// Locks in Ballerina are currently an experimental feature.
// Thus, use the --experimental flag to enable them.

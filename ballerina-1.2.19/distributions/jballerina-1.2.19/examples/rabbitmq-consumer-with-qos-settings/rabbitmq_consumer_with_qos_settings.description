// In this example, the messages are consumed from an
// existing queue using the Ballerina RabbitMQ message listener,
// requesting specific "quality of service" settings.
// These settings (i.e., prefetchCount and prefetchSize) impose limits on the amount
// of data the server will deliver to consumers before requiring acknowledgements.
// Thus, they provide a means of consumer-initiated flow control.
// prefetchSize is the maximum amount of content (measured in octets)
// that the server will deliver.
// If the prefetchSize is given as 0, it will be considered unlimited.
// prefetchCount is the maximum number of messages that the server will deliver.
// If the prefetchCount is given as 0, it will be considered unlimited.
// If the settings are specified at the listener initialization, they will be
// applied for the entire connection as a global setting.
// To apply the settings per consumer service, they should be specified in the
// service config annotation.

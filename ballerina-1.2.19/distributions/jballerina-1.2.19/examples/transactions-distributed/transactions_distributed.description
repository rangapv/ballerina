// To improve the reliability of microservice-based applications,
// a series of microservice invocations can be bound into a single unit of work.
// The underlying mechanisms are that of `infection` and `agreement` protocols.
// This example demonstrates the Ballerina distributed transactions protocol
// in action.
// Ballerina transactions are at experimental stage,
// please use the --experimental flag to enable them.

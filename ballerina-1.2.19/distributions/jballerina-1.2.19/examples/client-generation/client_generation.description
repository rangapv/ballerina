// This example generates a client for a Ballerina service.
// Add the `@openapi:ClientEndpoint` annotation to mark the listener(s) that are used for client generation.
// Add the `@openapi:ClientConfig {generate: true}` annotation to the service to enable client generation.
// The generated client can be found in the `<project.home>/target/bin/client/` or `<program.dir>/client/` directory.

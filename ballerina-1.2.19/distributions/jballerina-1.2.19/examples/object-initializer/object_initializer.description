// In Ballerina, objects can have a method named `__init()`, which is used to initialize the object when creating a
// new object. This method can have parameters as in any other method. However, the return type of the `__init()` method
// should be a subtype of `error|()`, which includes `()`. If an explicit definition for the `__init()` method
// is not specified, there will be an implicit `__init()` method, which does not accept any parameters and returns `()`.
